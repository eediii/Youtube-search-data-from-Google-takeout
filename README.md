# I know i can make it easier by writing better code at project.py, but honestly i am learning SQL rn and wanted to gain some experience.

[db.png](https://github.com/eediii/Youtube-search-data-from-Google-takeout/blob/main/db.png) is for letting you guys to see what happens after starting project.py. I mean, Youtube-search-history.db was created. And if you want to use this database at Windows SQL Server then you have to convert it to .sql file. I did this by downloading DB Browser. I learned it from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41802847).

[example pdf.jpg](https://github.com/eediii/Youtube-search-data-from-Google-takeout/blob/main/example%20pdf.jpg) is a piece of my data after i import it as pdf.

[html.jpg](https://github.com/eediii/Youtube-search-data-from-Google-takeout/blob/main/html.jpg) is an screenshoot of my data that i took from Google takeout.

And i am very grateful for sentdex from Youtube. I copied all project.py from his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Siyg1Wn5VDs)
