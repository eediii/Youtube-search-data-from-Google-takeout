# I know i can make it easier by writing better code at project.py, but honestly i am learning SQL rn and wanted to gain some experience.

db.png is for letting you guys to see what happens after starting project.py. I mean, Youtube-search-history.db was created.

example pdf.jpg is a piece of my data after i import it as pdf.

html.jpg is an screenshoot of my data that i took from Google takeout.

And i am very grateful for sentdex from Youtube. I copied all project.py from its video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Siyg1Wn5VDs).
